Here’s a clean and attractive `README.md` for your **CorrPY** project on GitHub:

---



**CorrPY** is a lightweight Python library that simplifies correlation analysis with intuitive insights and visual patterns. It's built for data scientists who want quick, meaningful interpretation instead of just numbers.

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install corrpy
```

---

## 📦 Import and Initialize

```python
from corrpy import Corrpy

corrpy = Corrpy()
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Usage

```python
corrpy.getTotalCorrRelation(df)
```

> Pass a pandas DataFrame to get correlation analysis across all columns.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📊 **Numerical vs Numerical** → Pearson correlation with strength interpretation  
- 🧠 **Object vs Numerical** → Association analysis (point biserial or ANOVA based)  
- 🔁 **Object vs Object** → Chi-Square based categorical association  
- ⌚ **Time vs Other** → Time-based trend and correlation detection  
- ⚠️ **Transitive Correlation Alert** → Detects misleading indirect relations
